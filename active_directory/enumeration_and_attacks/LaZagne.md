LaZagne is made up of `modules` which each target different software when looking for passwords. Some of the common modules are described in the table below:

|Module|Description|
|---|---|
|browsers|Extracts passwords from various browsers including Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera|
|chats|Extracts passwords from various chat applications including Skype|
|mails|Searches through mailboxes for passwords including Outlook and Thunderbird|
|memory|Dumps passwords from memory, targeting KeePass and LSASS|
|sysadmin|Extracts passwords from the configuration files of various sysadmin tools like OpenVPN and WinSCP|
|windows|Extracts Windows-specific credentials targeting LSA secrets, Credential Manager, and more|
|wifi|Dumps WiFi credentials|

**Note:** Web browsers are some of the most interesting places to search for credentials, due to the fact that many of them offer built-in credential storage. In the most popular browsers, such as `Google Chrome`, `Microsoft Edge`, and `Firefox`, stored credentials are encrypted. However, many tools for decrypting the various credentials databases used can be found online, such as [firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) and [decrypt-chrome-passwords](https://github.com/ohyicong/decrypt-chrome-passwords). LaZagne supports `35` different browsers on Windows.

It would be beneficial to keep a [standalone copy](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/) of LaZagne on our attack host so we can quickly transfer it over to the target. `LaZagne.exe` will do just fine for us in this scenario. We can use our RDP client to copy the file over to the target from our attack host. If we are using `xfreerdp` all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.

Once `LaZagne.exe` is on the target, we can open command prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the directory the file was uploaded to, and execute the following command:

        cmd
`C:\Users\bob\Desktop> start LaZagne.exe all`

This will execute LaZagne and run `all` included modules. We can include the option `-vv` to study what it is doing in the background. Once we hit enter, it will open another prompt and display the results.

If we used the `-vv` option, we would see attempts to gather passwords from all LaZagne's supported software. We can also look on the GitHub page under the supported software section to see all the software LaZagne will try to gather credentials from. It may be a bit shocking to see how easy it can be to obtain credentials in clear text. Much of this can be attributed to the insecure way many applications store credentials.
